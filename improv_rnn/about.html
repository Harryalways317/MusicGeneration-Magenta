            <p class="card-text">When you begin playing on the piano, we keep track of the notes you've been playing.
              This data is represented by a series of numbers that represent information such as the pitch of the note
              and the time the note was played.
              When the AI starts playing, this data is fed into the model, which is used to continue the sequence of
              music.</p>

            <p class="card-text">The entire system is powered by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). An RNN is just a type
              of neural network that can make predictions
              based on prior inputs in a sequence provided to it. Hence, when the AI is provided with a sequence of past
              notes played, it reads in this information, and outputs a list of probabilities for each note,
              representing the what the model thinks should be played next. We then sample a note based on the
              probabilities. Typically, the note with the highest probability will be played, but to improve the
              creativity of the model, we sometimes pick a less likely note.</p>

              Bootstrap 5 as the CSS framework. Tone JS was used to play the sounds made by the piano, and Magenta JS
              was used to build the RNN model. The model used has been trained on professional piano performances, from
              the Yamaha e-Piano competition.</p>

            The entire system is powered by a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). A
            neural network is an AI model loosely inspired by how our brains
            work, where the neurons in our brain take in signals and produce
            responses based on these signals. The neural network is taught by
            letting it experience multiple training examples. It then evaluates
            its ability to give the correct output. Finally, it learns from its
            experience and improves itself.

            specifically, we trained the RNN to predict the next note in a piano

            played by the user. So, what happens when you play our piano?

            As you play the notes, we record down the notes you play, and feed
            it into the model. Once the model is active, it uses the notes
            played by the user to generate an output of list of probabilities of
            the next note that is to be played. From there, the AI samples a
            note from this probability distribution and plays it. It then takes
            the note that it just played and feeds it back into the RNN,
            generating the next note in the sequence.
